                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">The world of rental is fraught with risk. It is a contract between two (usually) complete strangers
                                        where the asset under contract is of tremendous value. With the rise of property portals, and
                                        many owner/tenant agreements becoming completely digital, the relationship becomes even
                                        more risky.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">Till recently, the only way ahead was blind trust. Any information on identity, address, criminal
                                        background, or even financial viability had to take on the word of the person alone. Any
                                        documents had to be accepted at face value.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">As the number of property portals that offer online rental solutions have increased, the
                                        convenience of listing and finding rental properties has significantly improved. It has also led to
                                        an increase in rental volumes and speed of transactions.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">In the recent past, thanks to increasing employment-related mobility, increase in return to work
                                        and rising migration to metros and urban centres, the demand for rental properties on these
                                        online platforms has shot up. However, this also means an increase in potential tenants with no
                                        local references or ID/address proofs. This could potentially enhance the risk of identity frauds
                                        and misrepresentations that these rental portals need to be wary about.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">But those are not major problems anymore.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">Rental portals can now verify that all the information provided by users – tenants or property
                                        owners is authentic.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-bold mb-0">What checks are covered?</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">There are various details that the can (and should) be verified.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-bold mb-0">Digital Identity Verification</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">Digital identity verification methods such as biometric verification, face recognition and digital
                                        ID document verification can help verify the identity of a person online. It compares the
                                        presented data with the verified data set to verify whether a person is who they say they are. This
                                        is the most basic verification that needs to be done. This adds traceability of the individual and
                                        therefore security to the transaction.</p>

                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">One of the biggest worries that plague rentals is the potential criminal activity of the tenant.
                                        Verifying the criminal data of the tenant is vital to ensure security and peace of mind. A robust
                                        verification service uses multiple approaches in verifying criminal data of a person/firm/entity
                                        across various streams like using law firms, International Database Checks (online), Court records
                                        (online).</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-bold mb-0">Credit Verification</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">A bad track record in finances or unhealthy financial behaviour is a red flag that can warn of
                                        potential issues in payment. Problems arising from non-payment can also spiral into larger
                                        problems including legal recourse and eviction. Credit verification can mitigate risks and help
                                        avoid tenants with a negative payment history.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-bold mb-0">Verify. And offer transparency and security to your users.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">A simple verification checklist before listing can ensure that only genuine property owners can
                                        list their properties on the portal. On the other side, verification of the potential tenants makes
                                        your user base authentic, safe, and secure.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">As with all verification, a little care taken early can avert disaster in the future.</p>
                                    <p className="text-black font-weight-normal">Remember, verification need not be cumbersome or time-consuming. An advanced digital
                                        verification service can offer in-depth, authentic verification in real time. Look for a verification
                                        service that uses the power of artificial intelligence and information from government databases
                                        to offer instant verification results. And ensure that your rental portal has only genuine listings
                                        and users resulting in enhanced brand reputation.</p>
