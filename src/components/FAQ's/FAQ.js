                                    <p className="font-weight-normal">Employers conduct background checks to verify that the details provided by candidates are true or false. They may do this on

                                    <p className="font-weight-normal">Conducting pre/post-employment background checks on employees has become a matter of necessity for employers for sev-
                                        eral reasons. Many applicants make false claims on their job applications and/or resumes. There are instances where applicants

                                        have been involved in criminal activity yet choose not to disclose it. These checks are conducted by companies that want to
                                        ensure a safer workplace and avoid negligent hiring lawsuits. The cost of conducting background verifications is relatively small
                                        and can avoid costly mistakes in hiring the wrong person or potential lawsuits.</p>

                                        Record Checks. Nowadays, as most people have a social media presence, social media and adverse media checks are included
